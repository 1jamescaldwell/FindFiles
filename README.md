Project using: complex looping, matching patterns (re library), os, pandas, and excel read/write. 

A test series at my lab conducted ~400 tests. Each test has three camera angles. Each video has a raw format (.mcf), converted format (.avi), and compressed format (.avi compressed). Thus, the team needed to organize, save, and convert a total of 4000+ videos. I wrote this script to generate a list of the files that were saved/completed and which files were missing.
